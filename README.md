# CHROMA
CHROMA is a platform that helps you figure out individuals around you having similar interests as yours. This would help you to be familiar with more people and make you more friendly as you start talking to them. This webpage not only help many student but also the people in every community. CHOROMA's mission is to help people interact who has similar interest. In today's tech world people tend to share their problems and ideas but it remains in peopleâ€™s heads and gets bottled up. We want to connect the people who have something to share, people who needs to interact, not everything can be shared to everyone. We need likely minded people to whom we can share with.

## What it does
As you signup in CHROMA it asks some basic questions after answering those it will take you to a page which will help you to chat with other people who have selected the same answers. This will make match users with same answers and then it will help you chat with those users.

## How we built it
Designed and structured using HTML and CSS for the frontend of our project, while we used JavaScript (ejs templating language) as the backbone for the working of our webpage. We used ejs script tag in order to run JavaScript code within HTML. Further, using MONGO db for the database within.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Reasoning on different options to store and matching of users with similar interest.
2. While figuring out algorithms for different parts of our project was like an enjoyable brainstorming session, seeing some of it fail was equally annoying.
3. A more comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and learning wider aspects about these languages.
4. Fathom how to display our users and the chating with those users

## What's next for CHROMA
Currently, even though we can chat with users of same interest we are working on the updates. The next update can probbaly detect users with same answer's in a given range and can detect any unusual or creepy buisness and forbidden them from using this webpage in future. In future the users can put their questions in public to all the users.
